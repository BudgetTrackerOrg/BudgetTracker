# BudgetTracker

# Practices to follow:

- **NEVER** format code, this can cause unneeded conflicts in commits

- **ALWAYS** use the `--save` or `--save-dev` respectively when added new *node_modules*

- **NEVER** commit directly to master, make a branch and pull request for your commits

- **ALWAYS** have another person code review your *file changes*, **NEVER** use your adminstrive privilages to *approve* pull requests

- Branches should be *feature* based
