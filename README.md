# BudgetTracker

## Practices to follow:

- **NEVER** format code, this can cause unnecessary conflicts in commits

- **ALWAYS** use the `--save` or `--save-dev` when adding new *node_modules*

- **NEVER** commit directly to master, make a branch and a pull request for your commits

- **ALWAYS** have another developer code review your *file changes*, **NEVER** use your administrative privileges to *approve* pull requests

- Branches should be *feature* based
