# BudgetTracker

## Practices to follow:

-   **NEVER** format code, this can cause unnecessary conflicts in commits

-   **ALWAYS** use the `--save` or `--save-dev` when adding new _node_modules_

-   **NEVER** commit directly to master, make a branch and a pull request for your commits

-   **ALWAYS** have another developer code review your _file changes_, **NEVER** use your administrative privileges to _approve_ pull requests

-   Branches should be _feature_ based

## May need todo the following (Most likely not, try running app with only npm install, if it doesn't work run the following)

`react-native install react-native-vector-icons`
`react-native link react-native-vector-icons`
`react-native install react-native-linear-gradient`
`react-native link react-native-linear-gradient`
